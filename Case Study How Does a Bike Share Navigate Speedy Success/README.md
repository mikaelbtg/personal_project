This project is part of the Google Data Analytics Specialization on the Coursera platform. 
In working on this case study, I used the data analysis framework that was taught in the certification program, where the data analysis process will be divided into 
6 stages, namely Ask, Prepare, Process, Analyze, Share, and Act.
