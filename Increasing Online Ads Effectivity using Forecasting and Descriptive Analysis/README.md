This project is created as a part of the final project on Ruangguru CAMP. In this final project, a group of 4 students was tasked to analyze a 
dummy dataset from a fictional company called The Look. This e-commerce company specializes in fashion retail. We were divided into 4 departments in the company: marketing, sales, product, and human resources to analyze each departmen. I was tasked to analyze the marketing department. I decided to 
make the goal for the analysis to increase the effectiveness of online advertising to gain sales leads, which in this case, can be gained from new users and unique visitors.
In this analysis, I use forecasting to predict the MoM growth of our new users and unique visitors. I also use descriptive analysis to find a way to increase the effectivity 
of our online advertising.

At the end of the project, we were tasked to make a pitch deck on our insight for the company. I have also put those pitch decks in this folder if you want to check them. Also, here's an alternative link to the jupyter notebook, tableau visualization, and presentation slides in case you don't want to download the file to see it.
