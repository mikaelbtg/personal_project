# Personal Project
This repository includes all of my personal projects, both the ones that I create by myself and the ones I make with other people through a bootcamp program.
This repo was created to demonstrate my ability in using different data analysis skills such as SQL for data extraction, Python and R for data analysis, 
and Tableau for data visualization. Here are some short description about each project and the skills that I used to completed it.
