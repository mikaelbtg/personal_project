# Personal Project
This repository includes all of my projects, mainly from a course capstone project and boot camp program in which I participated.
I made this repository to demonstrate my ability to use different data analysis skills, such as SQL for data extraction, Python and R for data analysis, 
and Tableau for data visualization. Here are some short descriptions of each project and the skills that I used to complete it.

**Case Study How Does a Bike Share Navigate Speedy Success**  
Analyze a customer bike usage dataset from a bike renting company to provide insight to formulate a marketing strategy.
In this project, I used SQL to extract the data and R to do EDA and extract insight.

**Customer Segmentation using KMeans Clustering**  
Determine the company customer segmentation by creating a clustering model in Python.

**Increasing Online Ads Effectivity using Forecasting and Descriptive Analysis**  
Predict customer growth by creating a forecast model and try to supplement the company growth by increasing their online ads effectivity by extracting 
some insight.
