I create this project with my group for an assignment while doing Ruangguru Bootcamp using Google Colab. By using a dataset in Kaggle named Customer Clustering, we create an unsupervised machine learning model to create customer segmentation based on their characteristics using the CRISP-DM model. My part includes Data Preparation, Modeling, and Model Evaluation. We create this project using practice material on the same topic from our class, so our work is limited to adjusting the code for our dataset.
