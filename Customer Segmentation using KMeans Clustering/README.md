<p align = "left">I create this project for an assignment while participating in Ruangguru Bootcamp using Google Colab. By using a dataset in Kaggle named Customer Clustering, we create an unsupervised machine learning model to create customer segmentation based on their characteristics using the CRISP-DM model. I do this project using practice material on the same topic from our class, so our work is limited to using the same method for our dataset.</p>
